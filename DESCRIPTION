Description: For any two way feature-set from a pair of pre-processed omics data, 3 different true discovery proportions (TDP), namely pairwise-TDP, column-TDP and row-TDP are calculated. Due to embedded closed testing procedure, the choice of feature-sets can be changed infinite times and even after seeing the data without any change in type I error rate. For more details refer to Ebrahimpoor et al., (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.19523>.
